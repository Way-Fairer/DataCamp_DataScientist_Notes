Scope: part of the program where an object or name may be accessible. Names refer to the variables or, more generally, objects such as functions that are defined in your program. For example, a variable x has a name, as does the function sum. \n\nThree types of scopes:\n1. Global scope - defined in the main body of a script or a Python program\n2. Local scope - defined in a function. Once a function is executed, any name inside the local scope ceases to exist, so you can't access those names anymore outside the function definition \n3. Built-in scope - names in the pre-defined built-ins module Python provides, such as print and sum \n\nAny time we call the name in the local scope of the function, it will look first in the local scope, so if a variable is defined in the main body of the script but also in the function, it will pull the variable value from the function. If it's not in the local scope, _then_ it will look in the global scope. If not there, then the built-in scope is searched\n\nTo alter the value of a global name within a function call, you use the global keyword in the function. After the functions is executed, the global value will be updated if updated in the function\n\nPython's built in scope is a built-in module called builtins. You have to import builtins, and then execute dir(builtins) to print a list of all the names in the module\n\nLearning Python: https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-python-5th/9781449355722/","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3b8077d6-a007-46b4-aba5-dafb52dd090c"},{"source":"new_val = 10 # <- name defined in the global scope\n\ndef square(value):\n    '''Returns the square of a number.'''\n    global new _val # <- global keyword used to access the the value in the global scope\n    new_val = new_val ** 2\n    return new_val","metadata":{},"cell_type":"code","id":"f23c13f7-1047-412f-8087-da50ca7b16b6","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"source":"## Nested Functions\n\nIf you have function x nested within function y, and reference a name in the inner function, what happens? Python searches the local scope of the inner function, and if it doesn't find the name, it will look in the outer function (called an enclosing function). If no name is there, then python will looking the global scope and then the built-in scope\n\nNesting functions are good for using a process a number of times within a function, like adding numbers to multiple parameters. \n\nReturning functions: where the inner function is returned; so the function is essentially creating a function! You can use nonlocal to create and change names in an enclosing scope. Using the nonlocal keyword lets you update the variable in the inner scope and the enclosing scope as well\n\nAnother good reason for nesting functions is closure. This means that the nested or inner function remembers the state of its enclosing scope when called. So anything defined locally in the enclosing scope is available to the inner function even when the outer function has finished execution\n\nRemember the LEGB rule for scope searches: local, enclosing, global, and built-ins\n\nAssigning names will only create or change local names, unless they are declared in global or nonlocal statements using the keyword global or nonlocal","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ddf463a4-cd72-4035-a7fa-1f6ad249433d"},{"source":"def mod2plus5(x1, x2, x3):\n    '''Returns the remainder plus 5 of three values.'''\n    \n    def inner(x):\n        '''Returns the remainder plus 5 of a value.'''\n        return x % 2 + 5\n    \n    return (inner(x1), inner(x2), inner(x3))\n\nprint(mod2plus5(1, 2, 3))","metadata":{"executionTime":18,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"def mod2plus5(x1, x2, x3):\n    '''Returns the remainder plus 5 of three values.'''\n    \n    def inner(x):\n        '''Returns the remainder plus 5 of a value.'''\n        return x % 2 + 5\n    \n    return (inner(x1), inner(x2), inner(x3))\n\nprint(mod2plus5(1, 2, 3))"},"cell_type":"code","id":"320ed48f-7b08-46c7-bde7-8757e8ee67ae","execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":"(6, 5, 6)\n"}]},{"source":"# Returning functions\n\ndef raise_val(n):\n    '''Return the inner function.'''\n    \n    def inner(x):\n        '''Raise x to the power of n.'''\n        raised = x ** n\n        return raised\n    return inner\n\nsquare = raise_val(2) # <- this is creating a function that squares any number\ncube = raise_val(3) # <- this is creating a function that cubes any number\nprint(square(2), cube(4))\n\n# When you call the function square, it remembers the value n=2, although the enclosing scope defined by raise_val and to which n=2 is local, has finished execution.
